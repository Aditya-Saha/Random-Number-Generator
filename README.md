# Random-Number-Generator
This code generates random number in c without using any built-in functions and avoiding the use of loops and multiplication. 
Thus popular pseudo-random generator algorithm like  linear congruential generator (LCG) etc, are avoided from use. 
This code focuses on the use of logical opeartions for that purpose.
**randI(lb, ub)** takes two input lower and upper bound to generate integer random number between this range.
**randF()**  generate floating random number between 0 and 1.
